It was early in the afternoon, and yet Parson Jessel's great wig was
flapping forward with an unsaintly tilt over the pastor's left eye. Sir
Peter, a fat and tuberose-nosed aristocrat, in a blue coat and a
brocaded waistcoat, sprawled in his arm-chair at the end of the table,
his paunch abutting against the board, his full-bottomed wig flowing in
slovenly profusion about his blotchy face. On the far side of the table,
with his back to the fire, sat Mr. Lot Hardacre, a heavy-shouldered
gentleman in a scarlet hunting-coat and buckskin breeches, whose culture
was half that of a jockey, half that of a card-sharper. A long clay pipe
drooped from the angle of Mr. Lot Hardacre's mouth, and his coarse,
chapped hands were stuffed into the pockets of his breeches.
